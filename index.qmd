title: "Regulatory Repositories"
---

## Introduction

- R has a meticulously maintained ecosystem, which is immensely valuable in a regulatory space
- In a regulatory setting, the trust of any software needs to be thoroughly documented (NOTE: replace with more precise wording based on HA documents)

## Goals

- Provide a community-maintained catalog of package quality indicators ("risk metrics")
- Serve quality indicators in a standard format
- Thoroughly document the system used to perform quality assessment
- Demonstrate how regulatory-ready risk assessments can be provided using public quality indicators
- Serve subsets of packages that conform to a specified risk tolerance
- Improve transparency of industry R package adoption, endorsement and regulator interaction
